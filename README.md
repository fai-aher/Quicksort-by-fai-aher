# Quicksort algorithm implementation by @fai-aher

This is my own implementation of the recursive sorting algorithm of Quicksort.

* It includes a testing section for anyone who wants to try it.
* The implementation was made with the Python programming language.
* The document named 'Comprobación matemática complejidad promedio Quicksort by f.hernandezt' is a paper developed by myself where I demostrate the average complexity of Quicksort.
